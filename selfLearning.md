# Self-Learning: Payment Integration Mistakes

## Common Mistakes Made
1. Trying to create payment intents from server when they should be client-side
2. Double "api" in URLs (/api/api/...)
3. Not following existing patterns in the codebase
4. Not checking the API documentation thoroughly
5. Over-engineering solutions when simpler ones exist

## Key Learnings
1. Always check existing implementations first (e.g., Buy4Me payment flow)
2. Follow the established patterns in the codebase
3. Keep URLs consistent with API documentation
4. Client-side Stripe integration should use client-side APIs
5. Reuse existing components and utilities where possible

## Best Practices
1. Review API documentation before implementation
2. Look for similar implementations in the codebase
3. Keep payment flows consistent across features
4. Use proper error handling and validation
5. Follow the existing project structure

## Action Items
1. Fix payment URLs to match API documentation
2. Use client-side Stripe integration like Buy4Me
3. Reuse existing payment components
4. Maintain consistent error handling
5. Follow established project patterns
